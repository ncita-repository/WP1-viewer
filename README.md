# WP1-viewer
### NCITA repository Work Package 1: OHIF viewer

This is the place to go to upload code and other files relevant to the viewer in general. Specific repositories and projects of the form WP1.x-y are for specific second-level work packages in the NCITA repository strategy.

Note that there is a wiki for this repository, which initially has a page for feature suggestions.

The NCITA Repository Unit site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear! Note that the ICR also releases code related to the XNAT-OHIF image viewer at https://bitbucket.org/icrimaginginformatics/.
